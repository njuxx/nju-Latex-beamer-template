# 南大主题Latex模版2 (Beamer Template for NJUers - 2)

This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The work is adapted from [njumath_beamer](https://github.com/YLiu1231/njumath_beamer)(GitHub), whose author is YLiu1231 from NJU, China. I do some changes to make it template alike. 

Note that some of the elements are from [an unofficial beamer template for IMPA](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/impa-beamer-template/jbkhtxsdnqtb).
