# 南大主题Latex模版1 (Beamer Template for NJUers - 1)

This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The work is adapted from [an unofficial beamer template for IMPA](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/impa-beamer-template/jbkhtxsdnqtb), whose author is Rafael Vieira Westenberger from IMPA, Brazil. I change the theme color and the figures in the slides.

Color and figures are chosen according to:
